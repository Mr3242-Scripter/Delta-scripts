How to use loadstring with Pastebin (quick guide)

This is the easiest way to run scripts without pasting the whole thing every time.

Go to any paste on pastebin  
Example: my Timebomb anklebreak script or anything else

Open it and click the RAW button at the top  
Now you should see only the script as plain text

Copy the URL from your browser  
It should look like this:
https://pastebin.com/raw/

If it doesn’t have /raw/ in it, it won’t work

Now take that link and put it into this:

loadstring(game:HttpGet("PASTE_LINK_HERE"))()

Replace PASTE_LINK_HERE with your raw pastebin link

Paste it into your executor and run it

That’s literally it, the script will load from pastebin

Quick tips:
- Always use the raw link
- If it doesn’t work, check the link again
- Make sure the script actually works
- Don’t run random stuff you don’t trust

Example:

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://pastebin.com/raw/yBGyr4s9"))()
